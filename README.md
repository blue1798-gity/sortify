# Sorting Visualizer (React)

This Sorting Visualizer is built using React and helps visualize the step-by-step process of various sorting algorithms. It is interactive and provides controls to shuffle the array, choose different sorting algorithms, and adjust the animation speed. The project is deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Introduction
This project provides a visual representation of sorting algorithms in action. Sorting is a key concept in computer science, and this visualizer allows users to watch algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and others sort data in real time.

### Features:
Sorting Algorithms Supported:
Merge Sort\
Quick Sort\
Heap Sort\
Bubble Sort

### Interactive Controls:
Shuffle the array to start with a new set of data.\
Adjust the animation speed with the slider.\
Choose from multiple sorting algorithms to watch their processes in action.

### Technologies Used:
React: The project is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\
JavaScript: The sorting algorithms and the logic behind the visualizer are implemented in JavaScript.\
CSS: Used for the styling of the visualizer interface.\
GitHub Pages: The project is deployed using GitHub Pages.

### Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:\
git clone https://github.com/blue1798-gity/sortify.git

- Navigate into the project directory:
cd sortify

- Install dependencies:
npm install

- Run the app:
npm start
- Open your browser: The app will run at http://localhost:3000.

### Usage
Shuffle Array: Click the "Shuffle Array" button to generate a new random array.\
Choose Sorting Algorithm: Click on any sorting algorithm (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.) to see the visualization of how the algorithm sorts the array.\
Control Animation Speed: Use the slider at the bottom right of the screen to adjust the speed of the sorting visualization.
